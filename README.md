# CS181, Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata Theory, Winter 2020  

## Course Objective
Grammars, automata, and languages. Finite-state languages and finite-state automata. Context-free languages and pushdown story automata. Unrestricted rewriting systems, recursively enumerable and recursive languages, and Turing machines. Closure properties, pumping lemmas, and decision algorithms. Introduction to computability.

## Course Description
This course is an undergraduate introduction to the theory of computation. We will study a variety of abstract computational devices, from very simple and limited ones to highly sophisticated and powerful: deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata, regular expressions, pushdown automata, context-free grammars, and Turing machines. We will completely characterize the relative computational capabilities of these devices. Lastly, we will discover that there are important practical problems that cannot be solved by any computational device at all!

This is a rigorous course with an emphasis on mathematical proofs. Please do not enroll if you have not taken the prerequisites, which are CS 32 "Introduction to Computer Science II" and one of MATH 61 "Introduction to Discrete Structures," MATH 180 "Combinatorics."
